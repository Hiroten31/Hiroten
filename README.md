# Welcome to my GitHub profile! :heart:
My name is Miko≈Çaj and I am a Computer Science :desktop_computer: student at Politechnika Krakowska.

I am pursueing my dream of making great, interesting and creative games :video_game: 

In the meantime I am developing my skills in back-end :open_file_folder:, front-end :framed_picture: and over-all understanding of how all those the stuff works :gear:

Sometimes I also venture into world-building, 3D modelling, video editing and graphic design :thought_balloon:
